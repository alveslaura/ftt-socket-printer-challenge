# ftt-socket-printer-challenge

In a given logistics environment, the use of 5 thermal printers using the serial port for issuing the labels was specified. Printers are able to print using the Markdown language.
However, within this environment, we have 50 terminals for collecting information that will send data to make the prints.
It is expected that a Java application will be built that is responsible for receiving the print orders for each label of each terminal.
